Biking Infrastructure Must be Perserved

In Pittsburgh, it is city policy that construction activities that impact a bike lane, some sort of accomadation must be made. When a bike lane is closed (considered narrowing the lane to less than 4 ft wide) due to construction, the permittee must provide an alternative that is similar to the impacted area. So flaggers directing traffic to allow bicyclists through, a detour of some kind, or at the very least signage for bike traffic to merge with car traffic.
