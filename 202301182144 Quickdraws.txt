Quickdraws

Quickdraws are climbing gear that is used to secure a climbing rope to a bolt in the wall to catch the climber when they fall. 

They are composed of two carabiners with a sling connecting them. Each carabiner is designated for either the bolt or the rope and should be used consistently as such.

The rope side carabiner has a rubber keeper to ensure that it does not twist around (so the rope doesn't undo itself). It should always be kept smooth and free of scratches and dings to prevent damage to the rope.

The bolt side carabiner does not have a rubber keeper to allow the entire carabiner to swing free as the rope moves back and forth. Since this carabiner connects to the metal bolt, scratches and dings will form over time and this is fine and expected.
