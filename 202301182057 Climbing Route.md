# Climbing Route

A climbing route is a relatively long section for climbing that is typically climbed by [[202301182046 Top Roping]], [[202301182235 Sport Climbing]], [[202301182232 Trad Climbing]], or [[202301182015 Free Soloing]]. The definition of long is up for debate, but 40ft or more usually qualifies without argument.

Routes are rated in the US by the [[202301182233 Yosemite Decimal System]].

For indoor climbing, the holds are typically marked in some way (tape or different colored holds) and a climber can only use those that are marked and any features on the wall that are deemed "neutral" (e.g. volumes that jut out of the wall).

For outdoor climbing, the route is the easiest moves and holds needed to get up section.
