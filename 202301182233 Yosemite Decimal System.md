Yosemite Decimal System

This is a system to grade climbing routes. It is a subset of a broader mountaineering grading system and is only the "5" portion. The system starts at 5.0 and goes up to 5.15 currently, but it is technically open ended. The difficulties from 5.0 up to and including 5.9 have no subdivision, but 5.10 and above are broken down into a, b, c, and d grades. 

The rating has been expanded to also included the amount of protection available in [[202301182232 Trad Climbing]], G, PG, PG13, R, and X, in ascending order of difficulty/sparseness.
