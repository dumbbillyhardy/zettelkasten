Boulder Problems

A boulder problem is a sequence of climbing moves that do not involve ropes and are typically relatively low to the ground [The Climbing Guy]. This is in contrast to climbing routes that involve the use of ropes for protection and falls from them without ropes are easily fatal (see [[202301182015 Free Soloing]]).
